## ATTENTION INDEX USERS
For scrolling through the playlists in the UI, you need to fix controller bindings to scroll as it requires the thumbstick. Look at this tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4YKwmYvWk&feature=youtu.be) (Credits: Toni Macaroni)

Download the latest version of the mod (v0.1.1) [here](https://github.com/rithik-b/PlaylistManager/releases/tag/0.1.1 "here").

## Special Thanks
Huge thanks for both Auros and Zingabopp for their co-operation as well as their contribution to this mod.
Auros helped me do a full plugin rewrite with Zenject, allowing for a more optimized mod and Zingabopp created the BeatSaberPlaylistsLib library, which is what I depend on with this mod.
